Explanation for files:

features/support/world.js – It provides the context for running the test script. It includes necessary libraries
and key objects such as the web driver object.

features/support/hooks.js – It is used setup and cleanup code. In our case, we simply close the webdriver
object after all the features are run.

features/junglesocks.feature – contains the test script written in Gherkin. This is very close to English.
‘Background’ sets the context for the test scenario.
We can vary the user input using tags. See the params in <> and their values in a table format
delimited by |.
Given, When, Then are steps written in English with possible tags.
Examples are used to vary the test values for a given scenario.

features/step_definitions/junglesocks_stepdef.js – This translates the plain text Gherkin steps in English into
actions. Each of the Given, When and Then in the feature file have corresponding step definition functions.
